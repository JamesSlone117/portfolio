## **What Were the Greatest Challanges Building your Site?**

Well there were many challanges development but I am glad I had the time to go though and fix them! 

**About Page:**

Formating the about page was a challenge because the the 2 adobe icons kept sizing to the wrong size to fix this I used the class `img-fluid` which resized them depending on the screen size, looking back it seems pretty obvious, put it had me puzzled for a while.

**Videos Section:**

Displaying the videos on the homepage was one of my biggest struggles in development as for the smallest size the videos would always not fit on the page properly I believe it was do to this... `width="560" height="315"`.

As a compromise I decided to change the videos to images that link to a new tab using `target= “blank_”`  as I thought was a better viewing experience. In the future I would want to develop a proper way of viewing the videos on the page in full screen after you click one, but that will have to be another time.

**Icon Trouble:**

When putting my icons in my footer I had trouble because they were not appearing. It turned out I changed the font of the icons which led them to not display properly, I simply removed the `text-primary` class and it worked.


## **What have you Learned by Creating your Portfolio?**

I have learned many new classes in html that I will use in my coding journey!

Such as how to:
- use sizes properly with `sm md` and `lg`
- Embed videos into a website
- Use grid layout with `col` and `row`
- Hide parts of the site using `d-none`
- And much more
